# Contributing to MtconnectTranspiler.Sinks.ScribanTemplates

Thank you for considering contributing to the `MtconnectTranspiler.Sinks.ScribanTemplates`! This project aims to provide a framework for utilizing Scriban as a templating engine to generate files using the deserialized SysML model provided by the MtconnectTranspiler library. Your contributions are crucial in evolving this project and expanding its utility.

## How to Contribute

Contributing to this project involves a few steps, outlined below to help ensure your contributions are smoothly integrated:

### 1. Environment Setup

Ensure you have the necessary environment set up, including the Scriban templating engine and the MtconnectTranspiler library, to test your implementations effectively.

### 2. Fork and Clone

Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account and then clone your fork locally to begin making your changes.

### 3. Create a New Branch

It's good practice to create a new branch for each set of changes. This keeps your modifications organized and separate from the main branch.

### 4. Develop Your Template or Feature

Implement your changes or new features, ensuring they adhere to the coding standards and best practices mentioned below. If you're creating a new template or extending the functionality, consider the following:
   - **Clarity and Maintainability**: Ensure your code and template logic are clear, well-documented, and easy to maintain.
   - **Compatibility**: Verify that your templates and features are compatible with the range of SysML models processed by the MtconnectTranspiler.

### 5. Test Thoroughly

Manually test your changes to ensure they work as expected without introducing regressions or breaking existing functionality. While comprehensive unit testing is a goal, your thorough manual testing is invaluable.

### 6. Document Your Changes

Update the README or relevant documentation to include information about your changes, especially if adding new templates or features.

### 7. Submit a Pull Request

Once you're satisfied with your changes, commit them to your branch and push the branch to GitHub. Then, open a pull request against the `main` branch of the original repository. In your pull request description:
   - Clearly describe the changes you're proposing.
   - Link to any related issues or discussions.
   - Highlight any specific areas you'd like feedback on or are uncertain about.
